# Zuzalu‚Äôs Mission and Vision

**Overview:**

---

What is Zuzalu, exactly?

That's a great question. It's tough to define this amorphous and new community.

At its core, Zuzalu is a public good community, a pop-up city, a playground for cross-pollination experiments, a debating ground for exciting topics, a testing space for Ethereum-based technology, and a hub for futuristic-sounding disciplines such as longevity, synthetic biology, network states, and more. One thing we can guarantee is that Zuzalu is a magical community where real innovation and transformations happen. You will get future-pilled here.

After some spirited discussion and post-Zuzalu introspection, a group of contributors huddled around a Figjam whiteboard to scratch out something you are about to read. We hope the following statements resonate with you.
