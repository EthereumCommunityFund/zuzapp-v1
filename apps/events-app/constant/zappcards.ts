The tool is a playful first step towards decentralized agenda setting, question curation and community deliberation through collusion-resistant quadratic voting. The tool captures the intensity of individual preferences, but elevates insights shared by less affiliated members to surface issues more likely to be in the community's interest, rather than a social cluster's interest. To augment community deliberation, we have integrated this tool with pol.is, so talks may discover the consensus and cleave points between social groups. To learn more, please visit",
